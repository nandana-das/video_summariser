Welcome to our weekly team meeting. Today we're going to discuss the progress on our new project. John, can you give us an update on the frontend development? 

The frontend is coming along well. We've completed the user authentication module and are now working on the dashboard interface. We should have a working prototype by next Friday. I need to coordinate with Sarah on the API integration.

Sarah, how is the backend API development progressing?

The API is about 80% complete. We've implemented all the core endpoints and are now working on error handling and testing. I need to schedule a meeting with the database team to discuss the data migration strategy.

That's great progress. Now, let's talk about the budget. We need to review our Q2 spending and prepare for the Q3 budget allocation. Mike, can you prepare a detailed financial report by next Tuesday?

Absolutely. I'll need to gather data from all departments and create a comprehensive report. I should also schedule a meeting with the finance team to discuss the new budget requirements.

Excellent. Now, regarding the client presentation next week, we need to prepare our demo materials. Lisa, can you take the lead on creating the presentation slides?

I'll start working on the presentation today. I need to coordinate with the design team to ensure we have consistent branding and gather the latest screenshots from the development team.

Perfect. Let's also discuss the upcoming deadline. We need to ensure all deliverables are ready by the end of the month. This includes the final testing, documentation, and deployment preparation.

I'll create a detailed timeline and assign specific tasks to each team member. We should also set up daily standup meetings to track progress and address any blockers.

That sounds like a good plan. Any other items we need to discuss before we wrap up?

I think we should also consider the post-launch support strategy. We need to plan for user training and ongoing maintenance.

Good point. Let's add that to our agenda for next week's meeting. 

Alright, that concludes our meeting. Thank you everyone for your updates. Let's reconvene next Monday at the same time.
